# Pitted

Pitted is a tool bult for the Landlocked Surfing Commmunity (people who love to surf but lack access to the ocean). It helps these surfers find inland surf spots (river waves, wake surfing lakes, wave pools, etc.)

PUBLIC SIDE: Go ahead and make a search! There are plenty of test spots for Southern California, Arizona, and Michigan.

ADMIN SIDE: Add /admin to the URL to check out the admin side. The test username is "test-user" and the password is "123GetPitted!" This will take you to the admin menu where you can see all of the spots you have added, edit or delete them, add new spots, or reset your password. Admin will be community leaders from the Landlocked Surfing Community and added by the system admin, therefore there is no UI for creating a user.
